# Sabbatical Itinerary

**This is not a fully-featured project.**  It is half-baked and very much
oriented toward the happy path, as I was its sole user and it existed only
to help make planning my year-long traveling sabbatical a bit easier.
Some obvious features don't exist at all, because it was easier to just open
up the Rails console and do them there than to take the time to implement the
feature in the UI.

This was written while I was already on sabbatical, so as you might imagine,
I was more into the idea of spending time enjoying the wonderful places I was
travelling to than polishing this app into something more generally useful.
